# results reach this processor, so every segment received here is acted on.
#
# This processor does NOT touch removal_segments or compute_keep_segments.
# SegmentRemover is the sole owner of timeline cuts.

    Words are always muted — never cut from the timeline. If a muted word
    is adjacent to natural silence, CrossTalkDetector may absorb it into a
    pause cut (self-healing). If not, the word remains as a silent gap.

    This processor does not sample cross-track audio; it only reads
    detection_results["filler_word_detector"] and writes audio filters.
